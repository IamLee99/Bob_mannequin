'''
    "Chassis.py" is critical function ( can be considered as internal frame )
    that provides "BOB_the_Mannequin.py" pre-colored & shaped limbs,
    Coordinates of point of connection ( joint ) that continuously rotates for lower limbs, and
    function that rotates by point of connection than turtle's coordinate by using Math and setx/y.
